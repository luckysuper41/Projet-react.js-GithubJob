This is my first project about React.js with help from "Web Dev Simplified" on platform Youtube

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

For seeing my code, you can download the folder name "download" to your computer. After, you run:

npm init react-app my-app
cd my-app

And copy paste my file in my folder to your folder and run:

npm start 

Goodluck!
